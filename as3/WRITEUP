=Assignment 3, Cereal Data Visualization=

==Intent of each visualization==

* Bar graphs - show relative (and absolute) values of specific nutritional information
* Bullet graphs - show relative (and absolute) values of specific nutritional information in relation to the "daily suggested intake"
* Pie/donut chart - show percentages of cereal from different cereal manufacturers
* Hierarchy - provide an easy way to see which cereals are manufactured by which manufacturers
* Heatmap - provide an easy way to visualize (by color density) which cereals are best in various nutritional categories

==Visualization Techniques==
I employed many different visualization techniques for presenting the information. Using bar graphs were pretty obvious for the purpose of comparing the nutritional values across different cereal manufacturers, but I decided not to go with the stacked bar charts because it was a little too difficult to prepare the data that way. 

Bullet charts were also an obvious choice for representing the "suggested daily nutritional intake", and pie charts were the obvious choice for doing a percentage-based visualization. The bracket/tree-like representation for the cereal brands hierachy was also an effective choice, in my opinion.

The only visualization that I wasn't sure was standard for the purpose I used it for was the heatmap. Graphing basically all of the information given (cereal brands x nutritional information) doesn't seem like something that would usuabbly be done, but I think it was a smart choice judging by the time I and some of my friends spent looking at it and easily comparing different cereal brands.

==Data Preparation==

A fair amount of data preparation had to be done both because of the nature of the graphs and because of the specific format required by Protovis. In Python, I performed a lot of aggregation (via bucketing by manufacturer name in a hash table, since this was my main categorization) and normalization. Unfortunately, I did not end up having time to use any of the data cleaning techniques discusssed in class (dropping outliers, linear interpolation for missing values).
