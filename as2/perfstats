No, I don't think that the data is very surprising. It's obvious from the times taken to read/write to avro (either uncompressed or compressed) compared to that of the pure csv that somehow the avro library has a lot of extra overhead. However, I was a little surprised that the time taken to write the compressed avro was so similar to the time taken to write the uncompressed version, I would have thought it would take more time to do encoding/decoding/compression calculations and operations (and same for reading the avro files). Why doesn't everyone compress their files, then, if there's no time disadvantage?
